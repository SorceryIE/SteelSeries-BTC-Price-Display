# SteelSeries-BTC-Price-Display
Displays the currrent BTC price on SteelSeries keyboard using GameSense

# Setup
1. ```python -m pip install requests```
2. Add launcher.vbs to startup ( Win + R and type shell:startup and press enter. In the directory that opens up, paste the shortcut of .vbs file )
3. Run launcher.vbs (so that it runs in current session and in the background without a terminal window)

# Potential Improvements
Bigger text would be nice, could be achieved by generating the pixel image instead of using SteelSeries built-in text feature.
